This is a simple program created in order to add two numbers together using Java.
Initially the numbers were defined as integers and then initialised.
The progrm was then altered to define and initialise them simulatiously. 

The abstract Number super class and firstNumber class were then added to demonstrate
some key aspects of object orientated programming.
